A multiplayer Minesweeper with client/server.  
Configured to work on localhost but could easily work with remote server/client (just change localhost to whatever IP you want to use).  

To use :   
Run the Serveur/Serveur.java file (only once), it will start the Server.  
Then run as much Client/ConnectionClient.java files as you want, it will each time start up a new client.  
You can then create a Client account (button register) or use one already created previously.  

You can then access the Main Menu where you can either create or join Minesweepers games.  
Have fun !
